Buhari is also scheduled to hold a stakeholders’ meeting at the Presidential Lodge in Abeokuta to end the visit. Meanwhile, the ancient city of Abeokuta is wearing a new look as major highways, bridges and other major public institutions and places were beautifully decorated as part of arrangement to add colour to the programme. The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and the state traffic monitoring and control agency had closed some major roads to traffic. Alternative routes were, however, created and opened for motorists in the state while the visit lasts. (NAN)
