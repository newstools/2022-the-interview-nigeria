The Federal High Court, Abuja on Monday, stopped President Muhammadu Buhari, Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Senate President from tampering with the newly amended Electoral Act 2022. Justice Inyang Ekwo in a ruling on an ex parte application by the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) agreed that the Electoral Act had become a valid law and could not be tampered with without following due process. Justice Inyang held that the proper place to challenge validity of any existing law was in a court of competent jurisdiction. The PDP, through counsel, Mr James Onoja (SAN), sued the President along with the others challenging what it described as a bid to tinker with the newly amended Electoral Act. The AGF as well as the Senate President, Speaker, House of Representatives, Clerk of National Assembly, Senate Leader, House of Representatives Leader and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were named as defendants in the suit. Also joined as defendants in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/247/2022 were Deputy Senate President, Deputy Speaker, Deputy Senate Leader and Deputy Leader,House of Representatives. The party prayed the court for an order of interim injunction restraining the president and other defendants from refusing to implement the duly signed Electoral Act. PDP also applied for an order of the court stopping the National Assembly from giving effect to the President’s request to remove Section 84 (12) from the Electoral Act or take any step that would make the provision inoperative pending the resolution of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.
Hearing of the matter has been fixed for March 21. (NAN)
