The Federal Executive Council (FEC) has approved N92.1 billion for the construction of a second runway at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. The Council’s approval came barely 24 hours after the inauguration of the new terminal building at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos, by President Muhammadu Buhari. At inauguration of the terminal, the president directed the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning to look for special funding for the construction of the Abuja second runway. The President also directed the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory to conclude the documentation of the approved 12,000 hectares of land to accommodate the runway and other developmental projects. Addressing State House correspondents on the outcome of the Council’s meeting, presided over by President Buhari, on Wednesday in Abuja, the Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, said the administration would use same pattern it had used to raise funding for all of its other projects across sectors to achieve the new task. According to him, the Abuja runway project is expected to be completed within the next 12 months. (NAN)
