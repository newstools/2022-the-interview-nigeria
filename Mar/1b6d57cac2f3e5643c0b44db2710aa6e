Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says the situation is tense inspite some Ukrainian military victories in the conflict with Russia. Ukrainian defenders have driven Russian units from the city of Irpin near Kiev, Zelensky said in a video speech published on Telegram early Tuesday. However, fighting continues there and in other parts of the country. Russian troops control the north of Kiev region and have resources and forces, Zelensky explained. The situation also remains “very difficult” in the Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Donbass and southern Ukraine regions. Zelensky again called for tougher sanctions against Russia. Regarding an embargo on Russian oil supplies being discussed in Europe, he said there are now many indications that such tightening of sanctions against Russia will only take place if Moscow uses chemical weapons. “There are no words for that. “Think how far it’s come, waiting for chemical weapons,” he said. A group of Ukrainian and international experts will be set up at the presidential office in Kiev this week to analyse the sanctions against Russia and their effects. (/NAN)
