The group which identified a ‘Fulani Group’ paid N100m for both the the APC presidential Expression of Interest and Nomination forms. A spokesman for the group, Mayor Samuel, who is also the convener of the Youth Compatriots of Nigeria said, “We were deceived and brainwashed by those who claimed they could do it in 2015. “Now, we know better, under Jonathan the minimum wage could buy one or two bags of rice. What do we have today? We are begging President Jonathan to forgive us, we have realized our mistakes, we want him back to complete what he started.” The APC presidential Expression of Interest and Nomination forms sell for N100 million. There are now about 26 aspirants in the race to contest for the party’s presidential ticket at its special primary convention scheduled to hold from May 30 to June 2.
