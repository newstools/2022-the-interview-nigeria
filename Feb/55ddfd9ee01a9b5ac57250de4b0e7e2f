President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled with the family, friends and professional associates of founder and Executive Chairman of Complete Communications Ltd., late Sunny Emmanuel Ojeagbase. In a condolence message released by his spokesman, Mr. Femi Adesina, on Monday in Abuja, the president affirmed that Ojeagbase’s vision and diligence transformed sports reporting and inspired a generation of media entrepreneurs. Buhari commiserated with his wife and longtime business partner, Pastor Esther Ojeagbase. He noted that Esther worked with her husband in publishing, ministration and charity, bringing out many titles which include Complete Sports magazine, Complete Football International (CFI), International Soccer Review (ISR) and Success Digest. The president affirmed that Ojeagbase, who worked for the Daily Times, Concord newspapers and The Guardian, before pioneering sports news publication in Nigeria in 1984, was also a teacher and preacher of the Word of God. He further noted that Ojeagbase lived by the tenets of the Holy Bible, greatly motivating others to grow spiritually and apply the principles of honesty, fairness and integrity in business. Buhari prayed that almighty God would remember the good works of the media entrepreneur and philanthropist and grant his soul eternal rest. (NAN)
