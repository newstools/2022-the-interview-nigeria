The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has introduced “Self-Service Stations” in its offices nationwide. The stations will enable taxpayers file tax returns, pay taxes, apply for and validate tax clearance certificates, among other services by themselves. This is contained in a statement on Friday in Abuja signed by Mr. Johannes Wojuola, the Special Assistant to the Executive Chairman, FIRS, on Media and Communications. It said the initiative was aimed at supporting taxpayers in the optimised use of the TaxPro Max Solution. The statement said to make it more convenient for the taxpayers, the Self-Service Stations have designated officers readily available to assist taxpayers with any technical difficulty or concerns that may arise. The FIRS implored taxpayers to take advantage of the stations in fulfilling their tax obligations. (NAN)
