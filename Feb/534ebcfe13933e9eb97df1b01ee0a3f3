The President’s spokesman, Mr. Femi Adesina in a statement on Saturday in Abuja, said the president stated this at a sideline meeting with the Prime Minister of Palestine, Mohammad Shtayyeh, at the ongoing African Union meetings, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. According to him, Nigeria remains unwavering in supporting democracy, development and good governance, particularly in ensuring the rights of individuals and institutions. “As a country, we are doing our best, and we will continue doing our best to ensure justice and fairness,” he said. The President assured the Palestinian leader that Nigeria would be “consistent” in pushing for peace and progress, while upholding the tenets of justice. In his remarks, the Palestinian leader noted that the situation in the Middle East, particularly relations with Israel, had deteriorated over the years, adding that the world needed to know the facts. Shtayyeh thanked the Nigerian leader for his leadership role in the continent. “Your Excellency, we thank you for your wisdom. We need it more now. “Please continue to stay well and healthy, because we need your wisdom,” he said. (NAN)
