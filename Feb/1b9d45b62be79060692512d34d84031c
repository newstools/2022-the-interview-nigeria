The Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) says it will terminate the Kano – Lagos train in Kaduna following the derailment of some cargo wagons in Minna, Niger. Mr. Tyem James, Acting Regional District Manager, Northern District told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Zaria that Lagos-bound train would not continue its journey because of the evacuation processes. James said that the headquarters gave the directive to districts to terminate trips because of the derailment of cargo wagons near Minna, Niger. He added that because the rail line was a single track, the Lagos bound could not pass and subsequently, the NRC commenced the process of repayment to the passengers. He said that the Lagos-Kano operations have been a hitch-free exercise since the resumption of the operations on the route after closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic. James, however, said the minor electrical problems developed by the Kano to Lagos train have been addressed by the team of engineers from the district. He added that the trips on the route were successful until January 31, where train going to Lagos from Kano developed minor electrical problem which was addressed by the team of engineers. James said the NRC would strengthen its collaboration with security agencies and other key stakeholders to stop vandalism on the rail track and reiterates that a hitch-free service would soon be restored on the route.
